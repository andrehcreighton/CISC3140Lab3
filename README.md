# CISC3140LabAwk

This lab displays a report of the highest paid athletes in sports over the past 20 years and how much they've accumulated over such time. These totals only show the total amount a player has made while being on this list and does not account for total amount a player has made in their entire career.

## How this works

The data itself comes from a `.csv` file that I downloaded from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/forbes-highest-paid-athletes-19902019
I was able to download this and save straight into a folder where I would also create the `awk script` and `Makefile`.
