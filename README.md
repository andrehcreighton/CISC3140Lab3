# CISC3140_3.1_LabAwk

This lab displays a report of the highest paid athletes in sports over the past 20 years and how much they've accumulated over such time. These totals only show the total amount a player has made while being on this list and does not account for total amount a player has made in their entire career.

### How it works

The data itself comes from a `.csv` file that I downloaded from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/forbes-highest-paid-athletes-19902019
I was able to download this and save straight into a folder where I would also create the `awk script` and `Makefile`.

# CISC3140_3.3_EventListenerDemo

This part of the lab demos the way you can use event listeners in a project. Here I used it for a simple log in page where the user will input a valid email and password.

The files are provided in the `lab3.3` named `events.html` and `events.js`. Just open up the html file and input the information. This landing page will display a message at the bottom which will let you know if you entered valid responses or not. In the code you will see how these responses are validated with using regular expressions and a conditional statement.
